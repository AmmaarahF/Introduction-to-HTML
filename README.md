<b></b> - for text to appear bold (used for generic and neutral purposes)


Headlines
-------------------------------
- There are six different types : h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
- The h1 element is the largest and most prominent, while h6 is the smallest and least attention-grabbing.

HTML Lists

- there are three types of lists > unordered lists, ordered lists and definition lists
- <li></li> - represents a list item (these tags are nested in list tags)
- <ul></ul> - unordered lists are commonly used (lists items in bullet form) 
- <ol></ol> - ordered lists are simiar to unordered lists, an ordered list follows a specific order and are numbered.
- <dt></dt> - stands for definition term 
 > <dd></dd> - stands for definition description
 > both tags must be nested in <dl></dl> tags, whcih represents the definition lists

HTML Quotes
------------------------------
- <blockquote></blockquote> - used to distinguish what is nested inside the tags. Any other tags can be added in the blockquotes tags. 
- <cite></cite> - renders in italic. This tag defines creative work such as poems or books.
